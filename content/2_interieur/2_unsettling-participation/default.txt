Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Forests are not just a collection of plants and trees, they are complex ecosystems with countless entities interacting and participating in their creation, maintenance, and degradation. The Smart Forests Atlas shares different entries that involve human stakeholders, but on a closer look many more-than-human entities are also involved. This Atlas Story summarizes a new publication in <em>Environmental Humanities<\/em> in which we foreground the critical role of more-than-human entities and relations in shaping digital forest technologies.<\/p><p><\/p><p>In participatory initiatives in forest environments, humans are usually considered as the primary stakeholders. With the use of digital technologies, activities such as participatory monitoring or forest management have offered possibilities for more democratic engagements with local communities and forest inhabitants. However, these projects often involve distinct human stakeholders with decision-making power, and exclude those without the privileges to intervene. Participation in forests has thus become settled as an activity that prioritises certain stakeholders over others. While this can challenge existing hierarchies, it also reinforces privilege and power.<\/p><p><\/p><p>To challenge this anthropocentric understanding of forests as spaces to be managed and monitored by humans, this text explores three processes of \u201cunsettling\u201d that reveal how more-than-human entities and relations disrupt, transform, and reshape digital participation. By challenging conventional ways of thinking about participation, we argue for more pluralistic framings where many different entities contribute to the (re)making of forest environments.<\/p>"},"id":"05313b8f-802e-416e-8f8e-a7528a57ac20","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file:\/\/ga7bQUUtTszUbGSN"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Acoustic monitoring device 'AudioMoth' is an acoustic monitoring device that was developed through initial <a href=\"https:\/\/atlas.smartforests.net\/en\/logbooks\/open-acoustic-devices-audio-moth\/cicada-hunt\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research with cicadas<\/a>.

Cicadas, with their infamous mating sounds, are one example of such bioindicators in forests. A trillion-member swarm of <a href=\"https:\/\/atlas.smartforests.net\/en\/logbooks\/cicada-sensing-technologies\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">periodic cicadas<\/a> lives underground for exactly seventeen years before bursting through the soil all at once in the north-eastern United States. Every seventeen years, the <a href=\"https:\/\/atlas.smartforests.net\/en\/logbooks\/cicada-sensing-technologies\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">technology with which their presence is captured<\/a> has evolved. Their overwhelming auditory presence is nowadays monitored through acoustic technologies that shape new understandings of environmental changes. Not only in the U.S. but in many different places, cicada songs are recorded through digital technologies such as <a href=\"https:\/\/atlas.smartforests.net\/en\/logbooks\/open-acoustic-devices-audio-moth\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AudioMoth<\/a>. Through these acoustic monitoring technologies, <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10\/gm8h86\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it was found<\/a> that cicadas are adapting their lives in response to environmental changes. As bioindicators, cicadas and many other forest organisms are signalling and expressing environmental events such as <a href=\"https:\/\/atlas.smartforests.net\/en\/logbooks\/open-acoustic-devices-audio-moth\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extinction<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09528822.2018.1483884\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pollution<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upress.umn.edu\/book-division\/books\/program-earth\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weather patterns<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/arts-culture\/chernobyls-bugs-art-and-science-life-after-nuclear-fallout-180951231\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">radiation<\/a>. Such findings shape new practices for understanding forests. By attending to the ways these forest organisms inspire and shape new digital monitoring technologies, these living entities become more dynamically involved in transforming our understandings of forests and environmental change. Rather than passive entities that are subjected to data capture, attending to more-than-human participation reveals how bioindicators are actively inspiring new forms of relating and sensing.<\/p>"},"id":"e380c7c7-584e-47bc-8320-918276983535","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file:\/\/Rh5TfOFzbK0KJgIz"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Terra0 proposes a forest that owns itself through blockchain technology.
