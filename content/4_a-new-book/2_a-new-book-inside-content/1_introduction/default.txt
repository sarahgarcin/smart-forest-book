Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p><strong>The Smart Forests Atlas is a living archive and virtual fieldsite exploring how digital technologies are transforming forests.<\/strong><\/p><p>The Smart Forests Atlas is a research platform developed through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartforests.net\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smart Forests<\/a> research project, which investigates the social-political impacts of digital technologies that monitor and govern forest environments. Our research project considers how forests and technologies are co-constituted. Rather than advocate for smartness, we question how and why forests are becoming technologically optimised to address environmental change.<\/p><p>The Atlas platform includes open data from the Smart Forests project, and provides tools for researchers, stakeholders and publics to gather, explore, analyse, annotate, reflect on and reimagine smart forest knowledges and technologies. Atlases have historically been used as colonial tools to mark out territory and delimit certain bodies\u2019 movements through space. The Smart Forests Atlas seeks instead to open multiple trajectories and connections across plural knowledges and open data co-emergent with smart forests(note: This is a footnotest test).<\/p><p>The site draws on and extends practices of \"<a href=\"https:\/\/dl.acm.org\/doi\/10.1145\/3537797.3537804\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digital gardening<\/a>.\" Rather than presenting finished ideas, the Smart Forests Atlas is a space for cultivating ideas publicly and sharing multimedia content. It will grow visibly over time and interweave different perspectives, thereby generating possibilities for critical reflection, practical relations, and epistemic justice.<\/p><p>Moving around the Atlas<\/p><p>Rather than providing set guidelines for navigating the Atlas, we encourage wandering, lingering, returning and re-traversing the site. Four interconnected wayfinding tools underpin the organization of the site.<\/p><p><strong>Logbooks<\/strong> record and reflect on existing smart forest projects developed by scientists, communities, and artists, linking to multimedia content and open data.<\/p><p>A <strong>Radio<\/strong> gathers interview podcasts with smart forest practitioners, field recordings and more-than-human soundscapes.<\/p><p>A <strong>Map<\/strong> offers a spatial and visual representation of smart forest geographies and their connections.<\/p><p><strong>Stories<\/strong> situate and contextualise smart forest projects and Atlas materials through expanded narratives.<\/p><p>Different parts(note: This is another footnotes test). of the site are connected through a continually changing heat map of tags. By bringing together emerging digital technologies that sense, respond to, and reconstitute forests, the Atlas offers tools for attending to the complex socio-political impacts of smart forest technologies and how they reconfigure human, nonhuman, and environmental relationships.<\/p><p>This project has been developed in collaboration with the digital tools cooperative, <a href=\"https:\/\/commonknowledge.coop\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Common Knowledge<\/a>. It was first launched at the <a href=\"https:\/\/pdc2022.org\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Participatory Design Conference<\/a> in August 2022 and at <a href=\"https:\/\/smartforests.net\/the-forest-multiple-composing-and-digitalizing-wooded-worlds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Forest Multiple symposium<\/a> in October 2022.<\/p><p>We are in the process of translating select Atlas content into several languages other than English. Stay tuned for updated content initially in Portuguese and Spanish.<\/p>"},"id":"227e99b5-29ce-4e72-82c6-4e22b8ddff34","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
